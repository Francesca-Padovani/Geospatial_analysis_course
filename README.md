# Geospatia Analysis Course Project 
This is the final projectâ€™s report of **Geospatial Analysis and Representation** for Data Science Course at Unitn. 

The main goal of this project is, in first place, to explore the data provided by **Inside Airbnb** to apply different analysis to various type of
data in order to get acquainted with the libraries used in this course and to gain insights on *economic*, *social* and *touristic* phenomenon in big
cities, also by means of infographics. 

While conducting the analysis, I imagined myself having to answer some questions posed by a potential tourist in Rome, who was about to leave for a
short trip and wanted to receive some information on the city based on some of her requests.
